# Well Log Data Analysis üåç

## Overview

Well Log Data Analysis is a project focused on analyzing well log data in the oil and gas industry. This analysis is crucial for understanding the geological properties of drilling sites. The project utilizes the Log LAS format, a common data format for well logs, and demonstrates techniques for loading, exploring, and visualizing this data. Visit the Well Log Data Analysis [repository](https://github.com/aliyusifov99/well-log-data-analysis).

## Inspiration üí°

The project is inspired by the need for efficient and accurate analysis of well log data in the oil and gas industry. By employing data science techniques, the project aims to enhance the understanding of subsurface geology, aiding in better decision-making processes in exploration and production activities.

## Features üåü

- **Loading and Exploring Log LAS Files**: Utilizes the `lasio` library to load and explore well log data stored in LAS files.
- **Data Conversion and Filtration**: Converts LAS files into Pandas Dataframes and implements data filtration to handle missing values.
- **Visualization of Well Logs**: Employs various visualization techniques to interpret geological properties like gamma ray API and neutron porosity.

## Installation üîß

Clone the project using: `git clone git@github.com:aliyusifov99/well-log-data-analysis.git`


## Usage üöÄ

The project is structured into sections that guide you through loading LAS files, data filtration, handling missing values with the `missingno` library, and visualizing well log data. Key insights are drawn from plots of gamma ray API readings and neutron porosity.

## Technical Details üîç

### Data Loading and Exploration

Utilizes the `lasio` library to load well log data from LAS files, focusing on the Curve section for detailed analysis.

### Dataframe Conversion and Analysis

Converts the loaded data into a Pandas Dataframe for easier manipulation and analysis. This step includes data filtration to address missing values, using visualization tools to assess their impact.

### Visualization Techniques

Employs a range of visualization techniques, including bar charts and matrix plots, to analyze missing data and visualize well log readings. Special focus is given to gamma ray API and neutron porosity to interpret geological properties.
